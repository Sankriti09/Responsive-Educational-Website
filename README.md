# Responsive web design (RWD)
RWD is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. Responsive design relies on proportion-based grids to rearrange content and design elements.

# How do responsive websites work?
Responsive sites are designed to work on any size screen and device, from the biggest desktops to the smallest smartphones. Instead of creating different layouts to fit different sizes and resolutions, responsive sites check the size of the device and adjust themselves automatically to fit.

# Media Query in CSS- TO MAKE RESPONSIVE WEBSITE
Media queries are a feature of CSS that enable webpage content to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. They are a fundamental part of responsive web design and are used to customize the appearance of websites for multiple devices. They make it easy to change styles based on the types of device rendering the content, or the features of that device, for example width, height, orientation, ability to hover, and whether the device is being used as a touchscreen.
