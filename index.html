        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Transformative pedagogy "encourages students to critically examine their assumptions, 
            grapple with social issues, and engage in social action". Five suggestions for preparing the online environment for 
            transformative pedagogy are: "(a) create a safe and inviting environment; (b) encourage students to think about their experiences, beliefs, 
            and biases; (c) use teaching strategies that promote student engagement and participation; (d) pose real-world problems that address societal 
            inequalities; and (e) help students implement action-oriented solutions".
